I graduated with a MSci in Applied Maths and Physics from [Queen's University
Belfast][QUB] in my home city of Belfast, Northern Ireland. With a growing
interest in practical applications of applied maths and computational
modelling, I went on to do a PhD in Biomedical Engineering with the [Cardiac
Electromechanics Research Group][CEMRG] at [King's College London][KCL],
investigating the use of patient-specific finite element models of cardiac
electromechanics as a research and diagnostic tool in the treatment of heart
failure. Having completed my PhD, I am now continuing this research with
[Gernot Plank] at the [Medical University of Graz][MUG], Austria.

As an enthusiastic user of Python and Linux, this website records some of the
tasks and challenges I have worked on, and showcases some of the software I
have written and made publicly available.
