summary: Some projects can clutter up your repository with compiled object or
         bytecode files. git clean offers a convenient way to keep things in
         order.

The use of .gitignore files with git makes the maintenance of a tidy repository
a much easier experience, however it does have the side effect of hiding any
built files that you may wish to clean away. For example, in a Python project,
the .pyc byte code files generated can clutter up the directory, and when
building software with compiled languages there are often many built object
files that you may wish to discard.

That's where the ``git clean`` command comes in handy. To remove all files not
under version control, run:

{% highlight bash %}
git clean -xdf
{% endhighlight %}

or, to remove only files in .gitignore (thereby keeping any untracked files)
reported by ``git status``), run:
      
{% highlight bash %}
git clean -Xdf
{% endhighlight %}
