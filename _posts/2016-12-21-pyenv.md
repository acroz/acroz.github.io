summary: Managing different versions of the Python interpreter and installed
         packages can be a pain. pyenv and the extension pyenv-virtualenv are
         great tools for carefully controlling your development environment.

We all love Python - it's a fantastic language, however managing installed
packages can be a pain. How many times have you ran `sudo pip install` or
`sudo python setup.py install`, and ended up conflicting with your system
pacakage manager, or had some obscure import error because you accidentally
installed multiple versions of the same package in different places?

The standard solution for this is to install Python packages into virtualenvs,
within which we can install whatever packages we want without impacting the
rest of the system. Once `virtualenv` is installed through `pip`, you can
create virtualenvs anywhere with `virtualenv myenv` and then activate them with
`source myenv/bin/activate`, however we are still left to manage our own set of
environments, and virtualenv does not help us easily manage different Python
versions. That's where `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv` come in.

## `pyenv`

`pyenv` is a great tool for installing and managing different Python versions.
To install it, use `brew` on Mac or [install manually][pyenv-installation].
You'll then need to add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or similar to
enable `pyenv`:

{% highlight bash %}
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
{% endhighlight %}

You can then start by listing all the available Python interpreters with:

{% highlight bash %}
pyenv install --list
{% endhighlight %}

You can see that many versions are available there, not just from the standard
CPython but also anaconda, pypy and others. The standard CPython interpreters
are the non-prefixed ones at the top of the list. To install one of these
versions, run `pyenv install` with the desired version number, e.g.:

{% highlight bash %}
pyenv install 3.5.2
{% endhighlight %}

You can then set it as your default Python interpreter (instead of your system
version) with:

{% highlight bash %}
pyenv global 3.5.2
python --version # 3.5.2
{% endhighlight %}

You can also override the default version temporarily in a single shell with
`pyenv shell`, e.g.:

{% highlight bash %}
pyenv install 2.7.12
pyenv shell 2.7.12
python --version # 2.7.12
{% endhighlight %}

Another really useful feature is `pyenv local`, which allows you to configure a
default Python interpreter for a particular directory tree. This allows you to
use a different Python version automatically for different projects. In the
following example, the default Python 3 interpreter is overridden inside the
`project` directory with a Python 2 interpreter:

{% highlight bash %}
pyenv global 3.5.2
mkdir project
cd project
pyenv local 2.7.12
python --version # 2.7.12
cd ..
python --version # 3.5.2
{% endhighlight %}

## `pyenv-virtualenv`

`pyenv` does a great job of managing different Python interpreters for you, but
it still doesn't provide a convenient way of encapsulating different sets of
libraries in the way that `virtualenv` does. That's where `pyenv-virtualenv`, a
`pyenv` plugin, comes in.

To install `pyenv-virtualenv`, again either use `brew` on Mac or
[install manually][pyenv-virtualenv-install]. As with `pyenv`, you'll need to
add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or similar to enable
`pyenv-virtualenv`:

{% highlight bash %}
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
{% endhighlight %}

You can then make a new virtualenv with an installed Python interpreter
version:

{% highlight bash %}
pyenv virtualenv 3.5.2 myenv
{% endhighlight %}

You can then see a list of all installed virtualenvs with:

{% highlight bash %}
pyenv virtualenvs
{% endhighlight %}

You can explicitly enable and disable virtualenvs with
`pyenv activate <virtualenvname>` and `pyenv deactivate`, and use the global
and local features of `pyenv` with virtualenvs as the argument:

{% highlight bash %}
pyenv local myenv
{% endhighlight %}

This is a really convenient feature - I use it to set up a new empty virtualenv
for each Python project I'm working on, with a name matching the project, then
set it as the local default when inside that project directory. This means I
can install what I like inside that project without worrying about other
projects, and make sure that all the necessary dependencies are retrieved when
using the project's installation helper(s).

In summary, I hope you'll agree that `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv` are a great
pair of tools to lift a lot of burden from managing Python interpreter versions
and virtualenvs. Personally, I'm looking forward to saving a lot of time and
effort in managing my Python environment in the future!
